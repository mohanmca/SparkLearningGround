Let N be the total number of documents in U
Find n(t), the number of documents in U that contain t
Then IDF(t) = N/n(t).

Note that n(t)/N is the frequency of t in U, and N/n(t) is the inverse frequency.
if document d contains 100 tokens and token t appears in d 5 times, then the TF weight of t in d is 5/100 = 1/20.
 
Sometimes token weights depend on the document the token belongs to, that is, the same token may have a different weight when it's found in different documents. We call these weights local weights. TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.

On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found. We call these weights global, and IDF is one such weight.
